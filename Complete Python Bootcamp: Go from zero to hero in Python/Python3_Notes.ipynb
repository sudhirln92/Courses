    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two reasons we take this approach for learning the context of Python Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are coming from a different language this will rapidly accelerate your understanding of Python.\n",
    "2. Learning about statements will allow you to be able to read other languages more easily in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python vs Other Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple statement that says:\n",
    "\"If a is greater than b, assign 2 to a and 4 to b\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at these two if statements (we will learn about building out if statements soon).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 1 (Other Languages)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (a>b){\n",
    "        a = 2;\n",
    "        b = 4;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "                        \n",
    "**Version 2 (Python)**   \n",
    "\n",
    "    if a>b:\n",
    "        a = 2\n",
    "        b = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that Python is less cluttered and much more readable than the first version. How does Python manage this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the main differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python gets rid of () and {} by incorporating two main factors: a *colon* and *whitespace*. The statement is ended with a colon, and whitespace is used (indentation) to describe what takes place in case of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major difference is the lack of semicolons in Python. Semicolons are used to denote statement endings in many other languages, but in Python, the end of a line is the same as the end of a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, to end this brief overview of differences, let's take a closer look at indentation syntax in Python vs other languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements. \n",
    "Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A code block (body of a function, loop etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally four whitespaces are used for indentation and is preferred over tabs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is some pseudo-code to indicate the use of whitespace and indentation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Languages**\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (x)\n",
    "        if(y)\n",
    "            code-statement;\n",
    "    else\n",
    "        another-code-statement;\n",

    "        code-statement\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    another-code-statement```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how Python is so heavily driven by code indentation and whitespace. This means that code readability is a core part of the design of the Python language.\n",

The terms encapsulation and abstraction (also data hiding) are often used as synonyms. They are nearly synonymous, i.e. abstraction is achieved though encapsulation. Data hiding and encapsulation are the same concept, so it's correct to use them as synonyms.\n",
    "Generally speaking encapsulation is the mechanism for restricting the access to some of an object's components, this means that the internal representation of an object can't be seen from outside of the objects definition. Access to this data is typically only achieved through special methods: Getters and Setters. By using solely get() and set() methods, we can make sure that the internal data cannot be accidentally set into an inconsistent or invalid state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using OOP in Python, we can restrict access to methods and variables. This prevent data from direct modification which is called encapsulation. In Python, we denote private attribute using underscore as prefix i.e single “ _ “ or double “ __“.\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Your Module Is Imported By Another\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there's a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Suppose this is in some other main program.\n",
    "import foo\n",

    "\n",
    "Always\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It prints the string \"before import\" (without quotes).\n",
    "2. It loads the math module and assigns it to a variable called math. This is equivalent to replacing import math with the following (note that __import__ is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find and load a module given its string name, \"math\",\n",
    "# then assign it to a local variable called math.\n",
    "math = __import__(\"math\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. It prints the string \"before functionA\".\n",
    "4. It executes the def block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called functionA.\n",
    "5. It prints the string \"before functionB\".\n",
    "6. It executes the second def block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called functionB.\n",
    "7. It prints the string \"before __name__ guard\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Only When Your Module Is the Main Program\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If your module is the main program, then it will see that __name__ was indeed set to \"__main__\" and it calls the two functions, printing the strings \"Function A\" and \"Function B 10.0\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Only When Your Module Is Imported by Another\n",
    "\n",
    "8. (instead) If your module is not the main program but was imported by another one, then __name__ will be \"foo\", not \"__main__\", and it'll skip the body of the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always\n",
    "\n",
    "9. It will print the string \"after __name__ guard\" in both situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Does It Work This Way?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might naturally wonder why anybody would want this. Well, sometimes you want to write a .py file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.\n",
    "* Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing .py files like your script and running special test functions. You don't want it to try running the script just because it's importing the module.\n",
    "* Your module is mostly used as a main program, but it also provides a programmer-friendly API for advanced users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond those examples, it's elegant that running a script in Python is just setting up a few magic variables and importing the script. \"Running\" the script is a side effect of importing the script's module."

    "\n",
    "Let's explore a little deeper. We've learned how to create functions with <code>def</code> and the <code>return</code> statement. Generator functions allow us to write a function that can send back a value and then later resume to pick up where it left off. This type of function is a generator in Python, allowing us to generate a sequence of values over time. The main difference in syntax will be the use of a <code>yield</code> statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most aspects, a generator function will appear very similar to a normal function. The main difference is when a generator function is compiled they become an object that supports an iteration protocol. That means when they are called in your code they don't actually return a value and then exit. Instead, generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation. The main advantage here is that instead of having to compute an entire series of values up front, the generator computes one value and then suspends its activity awaiting the next instruction. This feature is known as *state suspension*.\n",
