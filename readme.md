# Data Science Courses and Resource Reference

I am working as machine learning engineer. I took various machine learning courses from a different resource available on the net. And also read a couple of books. I also made notes of the concept and so that help to revisit those concepts.


## R
I first started my journey in data science from Besant Technologies Bangalore (India). It is a very comprehensive course about the statistics and probability, exploratory data analysis, machine learning and R program. Later I come across a few books by written [Hardley Wickhom](https://github.com/hadley). It is fascinating to read Hardley's book, the author of many great packages such as ggplot,dplyr and tidyverse in R.
